# The Gamer's Journal
IMPORTANT: This Readme is very much a work in progress. We expect that it will be update periodically as changes are made.
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

- What problem does it solve?

- What did you learn?

Have you ever been in the middle of a game and you have to be a responsible adult and do responsible adult things? This product is for you. Are you a competitive gamer and want to have a cohesive record of your game play over time, perhaps with some video footage mixed in? The product is also for you!

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)

- [Usage](#usage)

- [Credits](#credits)

- [License](#license)

## Installation

No installation required. This can be found by navigating to (insert finished github pages link here). Please note that any data is saved to your local storage. If you clear your cache, the data goes with it. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md

    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

    ```

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
