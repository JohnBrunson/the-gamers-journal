# The Gamer's Journal
IMPORTANT: This Readme is very much a work in progress. We expect that it will be update periodically as changes are made.
## Description

Have you ever been in the middle of a game and you have to be a responsible adult and do responsible adult things? This product is for you. Are you a competitive gamer and want to have a cohesive record of your game play over time, perhaps with some video footage mixed in? The product is also for you!

The biggest challenge in putting this piece together was learning to work as a team and learning how to communicate with that team. From a technical perspective, it teaches much about how to construct your data for later use, how to retrieve that data and how to use that data across a number of functions. Moreover, this also teaches about how to make sure that the right data is displayed at the right time.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
