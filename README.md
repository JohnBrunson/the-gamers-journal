## Description

Have you ever been in the middle of a game and you have to be a responsible adult and do responsible adult things? This product is for you. Are you a competitive gamer and want to have a cohesive record of your game play over time, perhaps with some video footage mixed in? The product is also for you!

The biggest challenge in putting this piece together was learning to work as a team and learning how to communicate with that team. From a technical perspective, it teaches much about how to construct your data for later use, how to retrieve that data and how to use that data across a number of functions. Moreover, this also teaches about how to make sure that the right data is displayed at the right time.

NOTE: The Text Boxes Game Value does not do anything in terms of input. It is simply for display purposes only. This will probably be addressed in a future iteration.

The journal can keep track of single player games, multiplayer games, or both.
